   ```

3. **Install pre-commit hooks:**

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### Docker Development

```bash
# Build the development container
docker build -t nexus-scanner-dev -f Dockerfile.dev .

# Run the container
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app nexus-scanner-dev
```

## 💡 How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

- 🐛 **Bug Reports**: Report security issues or bugs
- ✨ **Feature Requests**: Suggest new security scanning capabilities
- 📝 **Documentation**: Improve documentation and guides
- 🧪 **Testing**: Add or improve test cases
- 🔧 **Code**: Submit fixes, features, or improvements
- 🎨 **UI/UX**: Improve user interfaces and experiences

### Finding Issues to Work On

1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/nexus-security/scanner/issues) page
2. Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
3. Check the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/nexus-security/scanner/security/advisories) for known vulnerabilities

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue

- Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it
- Wait for maintainer approval if required

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### 3. Make Changes

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the test suite
python -m pytest

# Run security tests
python -m pytest tests/test_security.py

# Run linting
flake8 src/
black --check src/
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new security scanning feature

- Add support for XYZ vulnerability detection
- Improve scanning performance by 20%
- Add comprehensive test coverage

Closes #123"
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_scanner.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run security-specific tests
pytest -k "security"
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Mock external dependencies

### Test Coverage

Maintain test coverage above 85%. Critical security functions should have 100% coverage.

## 📚 Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Follow Google style docstrings
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions

### User Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add examples in the `examples/` directory
- Update CHANGELOG.md for all changes

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Reporting Security Issues

- **DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
- Email [security@nexus-team.com](mailto:security@nexus-team.com) with details
- Allow 90 days for fixes before public disclosure

### Security in Code

- Never hardcode secrets or credentials
- Use secure random number generation
- Validate all inputs thoroughly
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Implement proper error handling

### Security Testing

- All code changes must pass security scans
- New features require security review
- Dependencies must be vetted for vulnerabilities
- Use SAST and DAST tools in CI/CD

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update your branch:**

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run all checks:**
