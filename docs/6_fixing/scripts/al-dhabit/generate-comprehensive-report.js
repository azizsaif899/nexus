// This is a placeholder script for Al-Dhabit agent.
// Its purpose is to demonstrate how manual scripts can be used to support Al-Dhabit's operations.
// In a real scenario, this script would:
// 1. Read reports from automated tools (e.g., from docs/6_fixing/reports/al-dhabit).
// 2. Read data from other sources (e.g., manual audit findings, external tool reports).
// 3. Consolidate and analyze the data to generate a comprehensive compliance report.
// 4. Output the report to the al-dhabit reports folder.
