## üéØ Priority Tasks (15)

### üß† Core System & AI

- [ ] **TASK-1 (Refactor):** Refactor `AmazonExecutor` to use the new `EventBus` for logging task status instead of direct file writes.
  - **Source:** `MONTHLY_PLAN.md` - "Improve System Decoupling"

- [ ] **TASK-2 (Feature):** Implement the full logic for the `DELETE` action in `AmazonExecutor` to handle file deletion requests from `GeminiReviewer`.
  - **Source:** `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - "Q3: Full CRUD operations for Executor"

- [ ] **TASK-3 (AI):** Enhance the prompt in `AICodeFixer` to better handle `UPDATE` requests, distinguishing them from `FIX` requests for more accurate code generation.
  - **Source:** `00.md` - "Foundation: Increase AI Accuracy"

- [ ] **TASK-4 (Test):** Write comprehensive unit tests for the `IntentRouterService`, covering all rule-based and AI-based routing scenarios.
  - **Source:** `MONTHLY_PLAN.md` - "Increase Test Coverage to 80%"

- [ ] **TASK-5 (Bug Fix):** Investigate and fix the `getProjectFromPath` logic in `AutoTester` to correctly identify projects in nested package directories.
  - **Source:** `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - "Q3: Stabilize Auto-Repair Suite"

### üîå Integrations & APIs

- [ ] **TASK-6 (Integration):** Begin implementation of the `whatsapp-core` service to connect with the `IntentRouterService`. Create the initial connection module.
  - **Source:** `MONTHLY_PLAN.md` - "Expand Communication Channels"

- [ ] **TASK-7 (API):** Add a new endpoint to the `api` app to expose `IntentRouterService.getStats()` for the admin dashboard.
  - **Source:** `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - "Q4: Admin & Monitoring Tools"

- [ ] **TASK-8 (Feature):** Implement the `requestClarification` flow, allowing `AmazonExecutor` to post a clarification request and `GeminiReviewer` to read and respond to it.
  - **Source:** `00.md` - "Foundation: Robust AI-to-AI Communication"

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend & UI

- [ ] **TASK-9 (UI):** Develop a new React component for the `web-chatbot` to display the multi-step thinking process from the LangGraph agent.
  - **Source:** `MONTHLY_PLAN.md` - "Enhance User Experience"

- [ ] **TASK-10 (UI):** Update the Google Sheets Sidebar UI to allow users to select which agent (CFO, Developer, etc.) they want to interact with.
  - **Source:** `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - "Q4: Specialized Agent UI"

### üìú Documentation & DevOps

- [ ] **TASK-11 (Docs):** Create a new protocol document `LANGGRAPH_INTEGRATION.md` explaining how the research agent works and how to add new tools to it.
  - **Source:** `00.md` - "Foundation: Comprehensive Documentation"

- [ ] **TASK-12 (CI/CD):** Modify the `deploy.yml` GitHub Actions workflow to automatically deploy the `web-chatbot` to Vercel on pushes to the `main` branch.
  - **Source:** `MONTHLY_PLAN.md` - "Automate All Deployments"

- [ ] **TASK-13 (Refactor):** Consolidate all `tsconfig.json` files (`tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.base.json`, etc.) to reduce redundancy and simplify configuration.
  - **Source:** `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - "Q3: Tech Debt Reduction"

- [ ] **TASK-14 (Docs):** Update `REPORTS_GUIDE.md` to include descriptions of the new reports generated by the `whatsapp-core` service.
  - **Source:** `00.md` - "Foundation: Comprehensive Documentation"

- [ ] **TASK-15 (Test):** Create an end-to-end test using Cypress that simulates a user query from the `web-chatbot` through the `api` to the `IntentRouterService`.
  - **Source:** `MONTHLY_PLAN.md` - "Implement E2E Testing"
