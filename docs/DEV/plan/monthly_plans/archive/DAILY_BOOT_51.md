## üéØ Priority Tasks (15)

### üè¢ Enterprise & Operations Scaling

- [ ] **TASK-1 (Billing):** Upgrade the billing system to support usage-based billing (e.g., per-API-call) using Stripe Billing, moving beyond simple tiered plans.
  - **Source:** `DAILY_BOOT_50.md` - "Implement tiered pricing"

- [ ] **TASK-2 (Security):** Implement a comprehensive audit log system that tracks all critical actions performed by administrators in the Admin Dashboard (e.g., user role changes, data exports).
  - **Source:** `DAILY_BOOT_50.md` - "Implement RBAC"

### üåê Ecosystem & Developer Platform

- [ ] **TASK-4 (SDK):** Add a "Recipes" section to the SDK documentation, providing practical, copy-paste examples for common use cases (e.g., "How to build a financial report bot").
  - **Source:** `DAILY_BOOT_50.md` - "Create interactive SDK tutorial"

- [ ] **TASK-5 (Marketplace):** Build the frontend UI for the App Marketplace, allowing users to browse, search, and view details for third-party applications.

  - **Source:** `DAILY_BOOT_50.md` - "Implement Autonomous Agent flow"

- [ ] **TASK-8 (AI):** Create a new UI component to visualize the AI's reasoning steps from the "Explainability" feature, showing the user which tools were used and what data was analyzed.
  - **Source:** `DAILY_BOOT_50.md` - "Add Explainability feature"

- [ ] **TASK-9 (Performance):** Optimize the vector database indexing strategy for embeddings to improve semantic search speed and relevance, especially for multimodal queries.
  - **Source:** `DAILY_BOOT_50.md` - "Optimize conversations table"

### üìà Growth & Analytics

- [ ] **TASK-10 (Analytics):** Build a "Cohort Analysis" dashboard to track user retention over time, grouping users by their sign-up week or month.
